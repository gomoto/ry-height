This directive gives an explicit height to an element with height:auto.
Use this directive to animate height auto when content is added to or removed from it.
Use CSS class 'ry-height' to define the height transition.
Defining a transition on .ry-height will define the transition for all elements with the directive.
To limit a transition to a specific element, use a compound class: (.my-class.ry-height).
